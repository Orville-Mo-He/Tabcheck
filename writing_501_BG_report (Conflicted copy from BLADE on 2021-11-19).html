            <h1 class='ArticleTitle'>Desiging for the Bits and Bytes of Online Courses</h1>
            <p>
                With the onset of the Sars-Covid 19 pandemic, a majority of educational
                institutions shifted their teaching modality from in-person to online, despite
                the on-going discourse on the effectiveness of online instruction. Although
                research has shown that the ultimate learning outcome of students can be
                independent of teaching modality, it has also shown that the two are not
                equivalent in nature (Ni, 2013), as the shift from in-person to online instruction
                carries a new and unique set of challenges and considerations (Varonis, 2014).
                The current models and systems for the design, development, and evaluation
                of online courses aims to address these through guidance on the structure
                and alignment of course material as well clear communication of course
                related information. The differences across online course formats and
                contexts, however, also bring additional challenges that are ill-addressed by
                the current systems and models (especially when considering Massive Open
                Online Courses (MOOCs), the unique niche it occupies, and the
                socio-pedagoical goals that drove the innovation of MOOCs).
            </p>
            <h2 class="ArticleH1">From In-Person to Online Instruction:</h2>
            <p>
                Although iterations of distance learning have existed since the 1700s, with
                online instruction being the latest, the debate between traditional (in-person)
                versus online learning environments continues (Varonis, 2014). Proponents of
                online instruction argue that: it is a possible solution for the minimization or
                elimination of the current barriers that prevent access to education and,
                when compared to in-person instruction, can bring increased: “convenience,
                flexibility, currency of material, customized learning, and feedback” for
                students (Ni, 2013). Opponents, however, argue “that students in an online
                environment may feel isolated, confused, and frustrated and that students
                interest in the subject and learning effectiveness may be reduced” (Ni, 2013).
                A 2013 study by CSU-San Barnardino’s Anna Ya Ni1 comparing learning
                effectiveness, through the lens of student interaction and performance, of
                online versus traditional environments evidences the theory: while the
                success of students can be independent of teaching modality, the two
                modalities “are not equal” in nature; the shift to online learning environments
                causes significant changes in student persistence rate and interaction,
                possibly due to fundamental changes in various aspects of interaction and
                the outside contexts of students of online courses.
            </p>
            <h3 class="ArticleH2">Interaction</h3>
            <p>
                Ni (2013) explains that:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                “An important component of classroom learning is the social and
                communicative interactions between student and teacher, and student
                and student. A student's ability to ask a question, to share an opinion, or
                to disagree with a point of view are fundamental learning activities. It is
                often through conversation, discourse, discussion, and debate among
                students and between instructors and students that a new concept is
                clarified, an old assumption is challenged, a skill is practiced, an original
                idea is formed and encouraged, and ultimately, a learning objective is
                achieved”.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                In his seminal editorial in the American Journal of Distance Education, Three
                Types of Interaction, Michael G. Moore2 delineates the forms of interaction
                within educational contexts as: student-content interaction,
                student-instructor interaction, and student-student interaction.
                Student-content interaction is “the process of intellectually interacting with
                content that results in changes in the learner's understanding”, without
                which, Moore argues, “there cannot be education”. Student-instructor
                interaction is the medium through which student interest and motivation is
                fostered or bolstered, and the medium through which content is made
                digestible for individual students allowing for the proper and full application
                of course content and its derived knowledge (Moore, 1989). Finally,
                student-student interaction is vital as it enables the development of students’
                skills in effective collaboration (Moore, 1989).
            </p>
            <p>
                “Online learning” however, “requires adjustments by instructors as well as
                students for successful interactions to occur” due to fundamental shifts in the
                dynamics of interactions that occur through learning management systems
                (LMSs)3 (Ni, 2013). Virtual discussions boards, for example, occur through text
                only and are dense, limited, and permanent (Ni, 2013). In such discussion
                formats, there is a decrease in: sense of instructor control, group hierarchies
                (which become “hidden, but traceable”), and anxiety (interactions become
                less intimidating), and increases in: “stress of rejoining”, divergence, flexibility,
                and transparency (“No one can ‘hide’”) (Ni, 2013).
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, although “greater online interaction was not significantly associated
                with higher performance for students achieving passing grades… students
                who failed in their online classes tended to interact less frequently” (Davies
                and Graff, 2005) (Ni, 2013).
            </p>
            <h3 class="ArticleH2">Performance</h3>
            <p>
                “Student performance is a multidimensional concept” that comprises of a
                wide array of aspects such as: course completion (versus withdrawals), grades,
                added knowledge, and skill building (Ni, 2013). Although there is no
                significant difference in student success, in terms of final grades and the
                number of passing and acing students, between online and in-person modes
                of instruction, online-courses consistently reported higher drop-out rates–
                averaging 10-20% higher than equivalent in-person courses; with some
                courses reporting drop-out rates as high as 80% (Carr 2000) (Ni, 2013). Ni
                (2013) also found that the failure of online research methods courses was
                consistently higher than that of in-person counterparts, a result which was
                not evident in similar introductory courses, suggesting that the courses of
                specific subject material also consistently elicit higher failure rates in online
                courses than in-person (Ni, 2013). Ni also found that a significant percentage
                of students reported that online learning experiences were unsuccessful (13%
                compared to the 0% reported by students of in-person courses).

            </h2>
            <p>
                The current systems and models of online-course design, development and
                evaluation provide instructors with practical guidance (and, in some
                instances, training) on what is needed in order to develop high quality
                online-courses, as well as provide means on how to evaluate the quality of
                online courses. These current systems focus on the establishment of

                Of these 12 universal criteria, six criteria (1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12) address the
                availability (and clarity) of coure-related information. Three criteria ( 2, 3, and
                4) address the utilization of the LMS and the structuring of content on the
                LMS. Two criteria (4 and 11) address learner needs, with criterion 11 addressing
                accommodations for students with disabilities. In isolation, this shows a
                focuses on the communication of course-logistics rather than the
                fundamentals of the designing of online courses. When looking at the
                individual foci of the six systems, the foci of: the utilzation of the LMS,
                structuring of content for virtual environments, and the student accessibility
                can be synthesized (see Appendix 1).
            </p>
            <h2>Aspects Ill-Addressed</h2>
            <p>
                One of the prime arguments for the shift to online modalities is the
                minimization of the barriers currently preventing access to education (namely
                location (residence), costs, and, in the case of courses open the the public,
                preselection (addmission)) these decreases in barriers to entry, however, stem
                from corresponding increases in the variance of student learning
                contexts/environments since students of online-courses may participate in
                the course from within any environment that supports the students’ access
                to the LMS in use and the course’s materials (recorded lectures, readings, etc).
                Learners not affiliated with institutions may, therefore, also partake in online
                courses that are open to the public, such as with MOOCs. This increase in
                variance of contexts from which students are able to partake in
                online-courses, however, introduces additional considerations that must be
                addressed in the designs of online courses, and that which are illaddressed by
                current systems of design and evaluation. These additional considerations
                point to the need for greater learner-centricity and greater differentiation
                between formats of online courses4.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Differentiation of Online-Courses
            </h3>
            <p>
                Online-courses may primarily be sub-divided into those which are developed
                for students affiliated with the providing institution and courses that are
                developed for learners that are not enrolled at the providing institution or
                party. Students affiliated with institutions have access to the various sources
                of support and resources provided by the institution in question, where as
                those that are not do not have access to the same institutional support and
                resources and might not have access to the necessary resources to fully utilize
                or even access course material (Lane, 2016). Students of institutions have also
                passed the pre-selection (application) process of the institution, which, in
                most cases, implicates a certain (suffcient) degree of prior educational
                experience, where as non-affiliated learners might not have had the same
                degree of education (due to any of the various barriers to entry of traditional
                education) (Lane, 2016). Students of institutions might also be required to
                take courses (based on specific criteria delineated by the institution’s
                cirriuclum), whereas non-affilliated students likely do not have the same or
                similar requirements.
            </p>
            <h3>The Special Case of MOOCs</h3>
            <p>
                Massive Open Online Courses, derived from the Open Education Movement
                and MIT’s Open Course Ware initiative (Guttenplan, 2010), came on to the
                educational scene as disruptive innovation, which aimed to rapidly change
                the higher-educational landscape and rapidly increase educational equity
                through the minimization of barriers to entry, bringing an alternative to
                higher education to learner’s of previously excluded populations (Lane,
                2016) (Oudeweetering and Agirdag, 2018) (Zemsky, 2014).
            </p>
            <p>
                Practically, MOOCs are semi-self-paced courses open to the public for free,
                often with the option for course certification for relatively small fees5 (Lane,
                2016) (Oudeweetering and Agirdag, 2018). “A good-sized mooc can attract
                upward of ten thousand students, who watch videotaped lectures, have
                weekly assignments that are for the most part peer graded, and on occasion
                participate in course-related chat rooms” (Zemsky, 2014). Despite the
                conceptual target audience of MOOCs being learners in demographics
                underserved by traditional-forms of higher education, a majority of MOOC
                student populations are highly educated learners (learners already served by
                traditional forms of higher-education), at times with 80% of the student
                population holding a Bachelor’s degree or higher (Oudeweetering and
                Agirdag, 2018). This is due to a combination of formal and non-formal barriers
                to entry still presented by MOOCS. Even though MOOCs have aimed to
                mitigate these barriers, the formal barriers still presented by MOOCs comprise
                of technological access, educational background, and cost. The current costs
                and technological requirements needed to participate are still higher than
                the cost-benefit threshold for less-priveleged learners (Oudeweetering and
                Agirdag, 2018). Almost a third of all MOOCs also require some level of prior
                educational background, further preventing enrollment of less-privileged
                learners.

                Due to the composition of MOOC student populations, the pedagogical role
                that MOOCs occupy has also shifted to that of a limbo state, where, for the
                educated majority of students, MOOCs function as a supplement to
                traditional higher education, while for those without substantial educational
                backgrounds, MOOCs occupy the conceptual alternative to higher-education
                (Oudeweetering and Agirdag, 2018) (Zemsky, 2014). MOOCs as a supplement
                to higher-education is further reinforced by the general lack of overarching
                curricula that would otherwise tie the sporadic catalog of course offerings,
                each covering not-designatedly-related individual topics (Zemsky). The
                catalog-like-state of MOOC offerings and the dual-purpose state of MOOCs as
                a concept has lead MOOCs to become the metaphorical “Swiss army knife” of
                online-courses, where the second O in MOOC ‘stands in for “one-size-fits-all”’
                (Zemsky, 2014); more appropriate, however, is “one-size-fits-none” as MOOCs
                aren’t fully designed for either of the spaces it currently occupies. Therefore, in
                order to properly address the needs of students and the socio-pedagogical
                vision of MOOCs as accelerators of social mobility, future iterations of MOOCs
                requires the delineation and differentiation of MOOCs into sub-categories.
